## Introduction
There are two things I really like, running and data science. That's why I said to myself why not do a project combining these two fields. I have recorded all my runs on Strava, a sports ride sharing application, so I 'll be able to study my own data.

## Get the data
I was able to get all my data by following this [Tutorial]. 
In short you just need to get your access token from your Strava account and then you can request your data via the [Strava API]
I also used this [code] to get my data as a pandas DataFrame.
